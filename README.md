I have not yet deployed the website, so the .env file is still present,
which is used for Supabase.
I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

To run the application and start the server, please follow these steps:

---

cd client
npm i
npm run dev

cd server
npm i
npm run start

---

Best regards,
